# Patika.dev and Akbank - React Native Bootcamp - 2022

## Introduction

This is a React Native bootcamp project for assignment 1 which is building the Home page of Instagram.

## What I have used

And, I have used react-native-vector-icons, expo-linear-gradient

1. **expo-linear-gradient** - A library that allows you to create a linear gradient.
   > expo install expo-linear-gradient

Then, we need to follow the additional instruction because it is a bare React Native app.

```bash
# easy script to install all the dependencies for the project
npx pod-install

# or
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# then run the app for ios simulator
yarn ios

# then run the app for ios simulator
yarn android
```

2. **react-native-vector-icons** is a library which brings icon libraries such as Feather, FontAwesome, MaterialIcons, etc.
